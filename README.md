# The-spanning-tree-algorithm-for-extended-LANs

This is a C program that simulates the spanning tree algorithm for extended LANs.

Input

The extended LAN will be given in a text file. We make several assumptions to simplify the implemen- tation. An extended LAN with n bridges has 1, 2, 3, · · · , n as the IDs of the bridges. If there are m LANs, they are represented by first m capital letters. The file contains n lines, one for each bridge. Each line begins with the ID of one bridge, followed by the list of the LANs it is connected to. The names of LANs are separated by one or more spaces.
